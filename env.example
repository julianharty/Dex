# Dex - API Keys Configuration
#
# NOTE: This file is created automatically by /setup if you enable automatic meeting processing.
# Most users don't need to manually edit this file.
#
# ===========================================
# What needs API keys?
# ===========================================
#
# 99% of Dex features work through Cursor - NO setup needed!
#
# API keys are ONLY for:
# - Automatic background meeting processing (runs when Cursor is closed)
# - /prompt-improver calling Anthropic API directly (optional optimization)
#
# ===========================================
# API Keys (add ONE of these)
