# External

Customers, prospects, partners, and external stakeholders.

## What Goes Here

- **Customers** — Users of your product, key accounts
- **Prospects** — Potential customers or partners
- **Partners** — Integration partners, vendors, contractors
- **Community** — Open source contributors, community members, advocates
- **Other stakeholders** — Anyone external you interact with regularly

## Key Sections

For each person, track:
- **Role and company** — What they do, who they work for
- **Relationship** — How you know them, context of relationship
- **Recent meetings** — Auto-linked from `00-Inbox/Meetings/`
- **Key topics** — What they care about, ongoing discussions
- **Action items** — What you owe them / they owe you
- **Notes** — Important context (preferences, pain points, goals)

## Companies vs. People

Person pages in External/ represent individuals. When you process meetings with external people, company pages are automatically created in `05-Areas/Companies/` to aggregate all contacts, meetings, and tasks for that organization.

You can link person pages to their company page to see organization-level context.

## Usage

- **Before customer calls** — Review their page for context
- **After interactions** — Update with new insights or commitments
- **During planning** — Check who you need to follow up with
- **For feedback** — Track feature requests or pain points they've mentioned

## Integration

- Links to relevant projects (if they're a stakeholder)
- Meeting notes auto-link here
- Action items surface on their pages
- Company pages (in `05-Areas/Companies/`) automatically aggregate all contacts from the same organization
