# Areas

Ongoing responsibilities and areas of focus that don't have an end date.

## What Makes Something an Area?

An area:
- **Never finishes** — It's an ongoing responsibility
- **Requires maintenance** — Regular attention over time
- **Has standards** — You want to maintain a certain level of quality

## Default Areas

Everyone gets:
- **People/** — Relationships you maintain (colleagues, customers, partners)

## Role-Specific Areas

During onboarding, additional areas are created based on your role:

**For Sales/Account Management:**
- `Companies/` — External organizations and account tracking (universal folder for all users)

**For Managers:**
- `Team/` — Direct reports and team development

**For Content Creators:**
- `Content/` — Thought leadership and published work

**For Customer Success:**
- `Customers/` — Customer relationships and health tracking

## Naming Convention

`Area_Name/` (folder) or `Area_Name.md` (file)

## vs. Projects

**Area** = ongoing responsibility ("Manage customer relationships")  
**Project** = has an end ("Onboard Acme Corp")

Projects often live within areas—for example, a specific onboarding might be a project, but customer success is the area.
