# Ideas

Quick thoughts and ideas to process later.

## What Goes Here

- Random thoughts that pop up during the day
- Product ideas
- Content topics
- Process improvements
- Things to explore or research

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD - Idea Topic.md` or just `Topic.md` for quick captures

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — Drop ideas here without overthinking
2. **Triage** — Run `/triage` to process and organize
3. **Move** — Actionable ideas become tasks or projects, reference ideas move to 06-Resources/

## Dex System Ideas

For ideas about improving Dex itself, you can use the `capture_idea` MCP tool which saves to `System/Dex_Backlog.md` and runs AI ranking. Then use `/dex-backlog` to review priorities.

## Tips

- Capture first, organize later
- Don't self-censor during capture
- Review during weekly planning to spot patterns
- If an idea sits for 30+ days without action, either commit or delete

## Processing Ideas

During triage, ask:
- **Actionable now?** → Create task or project
- **Need research?** → Add to reading list or research backlog
- **Reference material?** → Move to 06-Resources/
- **Not important?** → Delete
