# Inbox

Temporary holding area for orphaned files that need routing.

## What Goes Here

Standalone files that arrive without context:
- Screenshots you want to file later
- PDFs or exports that need a home
- Files forwarded from email or other tools

## Primary Capture is Conversational

Don't use this folder for day-to-day capture. Just tell Claude things:

```
You: "Sarah worried about timeline but interested in Q2 pilot"
Claude: "Add to Sarah's person page and Q2 Planning project?"
You: "Yes"
```

The system routes intelligently based on your Week Priorities and Goals.

## When to Use `/triage`

Run `/triage` periodically to:
- Route standalone files in this folder
- Find scattered `- [ ]` tasks across notes
- Clean up orphaned items

## Inbox Zero

Aim to keep this folder empty. Files here are exceptions, not the norm.
