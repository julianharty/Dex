# Projects

Time-bound initiatives with clear goals and deliverables.

## What Makes Something a Project?

A project has:
- **Clear outcome** — Specific deliverable or result
- **End date** — Defined completion point
- **Active work** — You're currently working on it

When a project is done, move it to `07-Archives/Projects/`.

## Examples

- Product launches
- Feature development
- Migrations or technical upgrades
- Campaign execution
- Time-bound research

## Template

Each project should track:
- **Status** — Current state and progress
- **Next actions** — What needs to happen next
- **Key stakeholders** — Who's involved
- **Timeline** — Important dates and milestones
- **Related meetings** — Links to meeting notes
- **Decisions** — Key choices made along the way

## Naming Convention

`Project_Name.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD - Project_Name.md` for dated projects

## vs. Areas

**Project** = has an end ("Ship payments redesign")  
**Area** = ongoing responsibility ("Customer success management")

If it never "finishes," it belongs in `05-Areas/`, not here.
