# Skills: Your Personal Operating System Commands

**Purpose:** Slash commands that trigger multi-step workflows - your personalized interface to everything Dex can do.

**The magic:** You don't code skills, you describe them. Tell Claude what you want (ideally through voice), it creates the skill. Two weeks in, you're building custom workflows. That's the point - going from "user" to "builder" through daily practice on something you actually use.

---

## What Are Skills?

**Skills** are commands that trigger complex workflows in seconds. Type `/daily-plan` and get your entire day organized - calendar analyzed, tasks prioritized, meeting context prepared, focus items selected. That 30-minute manual process? Now takes 5 minutes, runs every morning, gets smarter every time.

Think of skills as **expert modes** you activate on demand. Like switching to specialized tools for specific jobs, skills equip Claude with domain expertise, workflows, and context for particular tasks. The difference? These tools learn your preferences and adapt to how you work.

### The Power of Skills: Chat Interface vs Operating System

Skills transform Claude from conversation partner into execution engine:

**Chat interface (no skills):**
- You: "Can you help me plan my day?"
- Claude: "Sure! What do you have on your calendar today?"
- You: *Pastes calendar* "And here are my tasks..."
- Claude: "What are your priorities this week?"
- You: *Explains context*
- Result: 15 minutes of back-and-forth, manual pasting, inconsistent format

**Operating system (with skills):**
- You: `/daily-plan`
- Claude: *Checks calendar automatically, reads tasks from 03-Tasks/Tasks.md, loads week priorities, analyzes meeting attendees, pulls person context, detects commitments due today*
- Result: Complete daily plan in 30 seconds. Same format every time. Context automatically loaded.

**Real examples from Dex:**
- `/daily-plan` - Morning planning (calendar + tasks + priorities + meeting prep) in one command
- `/career-coach` - Career coaching with 4 modes (weekly reports, self-reviews, promotion assessments, monthly reflections)
- `/meeting-prep [person]` - Deep prep with full relationship context, past meetings, open items
- `/week-review` - Weekly synthesis that learns from your patterns and suggests improvements
- `/dex-improve` - System evolution workshop that turns improvement ideas into implementation plans

**Anthropic skills for general productivity:**
- `/anthropic-xlsx` - Create, edit, analyze spreadsheets with formulas and formatting
- `/anthropic-docx` - Word documents with tracked changes and comments
- `/product-brief` - Extract product ideas through guided questions and generate full PRD

### How Skills Work

**Simple version:**
1. Skills live in this folder as instruction files
2. You run a skill by typing `/skill-name` (like `/daily-plan`)
3. Claude reads the instructions and follows them
4. You get the result

**Example:** When you type `/daily-plan`, Claude:
- Checks your calendar for today's meetings
- Reviews your task list
- Looks at your weekly priorities
- Generates a focused plan for your day

### Skills Format

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard - a universal format that works across AI assistants.

**Two parts:**

**1. Metadata** (at the top, tells Claude about the skill):
```yaml
---
name: daily-plan
description: Generate context-aware daily plan with calendar and tasks
---
```

**2. Instructions** (the rest of the file):
```
## How This Skill Works

1. Check the calendar for today
2. Review 03-Tasks/Tasks.md for high-priority items
3. Create a daily plan...
```

**Structure:**
- Each skill gets its own folder: `.claude/skills/daily-plan/`
- Main file is always called `SKILL.md`
- Can include supporting files (templates, scripts, examples)

**Benefits:**
- **Reusable** - run the same workflow anytime
- **Consistent** - same result every time
- **Organized** - each skill has its own space
- **Shareable** - works across AI assistants following Agent Skills standard

### Skills vs Agents

| Aspect | Skills | Agents |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Invocation** | You type `/skill-name` or Claude loads it | Claude delegates work to isolated subagent |
| **Context** | Runs in your current conversation | Separate context window |
| **Interaction** | Can be interactive | Autonomous (no interruptions) |
| **Use case** | User-facing workflows | Background analysis/processing |
| **Example** | `/daily-plan` - start your day | `project-health` - analyze all projects |

## Creating Your Own Skills

Want to create a custom skill? Run `/anthropic-skill-creator` for comprehensive guidance.

### When to Create a Skill

Create a skill when you have:
- **Repeated workflow** - You do the same multi-step process regularly
- **Domain expertise** - Specialized knowledge Claude doesn't have by default
- **Tool integration** - Need to orchestrate multiple tools in sequence
- **Complex logic** - Business rules, schemas, or procedures that need precision

### Quick Start

1. **Run the skill creator:**
   ```
   /anthropic-skill-creator
   ```

2. **Follow the guided process** to define:
   - Skill name and description
   - When it should be triggered
   - Step-by-step workflow
   - Required tools and resources

3. **Test and refine:**
   - Use your new skill with `/your-skill-name`
   - Iterate on the instructions based on results

### Skill Ideas

**Personal:**
- `/workout-plan` - Generate exercise routines based on goals
- `/recipe-scale` - Scale recipes and adjust cooking times
- `/expense-categorize` - Categorize expenses for budgeting

**Work:**
- `/standup-prep` - Generate daily standup update from recent work
- `/bug-triage` - Prioritize and categorize bug reports
- `/interview-prep` - Prepare for conducting technical interviews

**Content:**
- `/blog-outline` - Convert rough notes into structured blog outline
- `/social-adapt` - Adapt content for different social platforms
- `/newsletter-draft` - Compile recent highlights into newsletter

The best skills solve **your** specific problems. Don't build generic tools - build for your actual workflows.

## What Goes Here

Skill definition files (`SKILL.md` format) that:
- Define user-invoked commands (e.g., `/daily-plan`, `/review`)
- Orchestrate tools and workflows
- Provide interactive guidance
- Execute single-purpose tasks

## When to Use

Create a skill when:
- **User-initiated** - Command invoked explicitly by user
- **Clear purpose** - Solves one specific job-to-be-done
- **Reusable** - Used repeatedly, not one-time setup
- **Tool orchestration** - Coordinates multiple tool calls

Don't create a skill for:
- Autonomous background tasks (use agents instead)
- One-time setup flows (use flows instead)
- Internal utilities (use hooks instead)

## Structure

Skills follow Agent Skills standard:

```
skill-name/
└── SKILL.md       # Full skill definition with metadata
```

Invoked with `/skill-name` - automatically discovered by Claude.
