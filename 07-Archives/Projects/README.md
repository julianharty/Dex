# Archived Projects

Completed or cancelled projects for historical reference.

## What Goes Here

Projects move here when they:
- **Complete** — Goal achieved, deliverable shipped
- **Cancel** — No longer pursuing
- **Go dormant** — Paused indefinitely

## When to Archive

Move projects here when:
- No active work remains
- All follow-ups are complete
- It's been 30+ days since last update

Don't archive too early—active follow-ups or maintenance means it should stay in `04-Projects/`.

## What to Include

Before archiving, add:
- **Completion date** — When it finished
- **Outcome** — What shipped, what was achieved
- **Key learnings** — What you'd do differently
- **Impact** — Results, metrics, feedback

## Format

Keep the same filename and add completion metadata:

```markdown
# Project Name

**Status:** Completed  
**Completion Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Outcome:** Shipped v2.0 with 95% customer satisfaction
