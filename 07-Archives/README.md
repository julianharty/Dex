# Archives

Historical records and completed work.

## Subfolders

- **Projects/** — Completed or cancelled projects
- **Plans/** — Daily and weekly plans (auto-archived)
- **Reviews/** — Daily, weekly, and quarterly reviews (auto-archived)

## What Goes Here

Anything that:
- Is no longer active
- Has historical value
- You might need to reference occasionally
- Should be preserved but removed from active areas

## Auto-Archiving

Some files move here automatically:
- **Daily plans** → archived after `/daily-plan` runs
- **Daily reviews** → archived after `/daily-review` runs
- **Weekly plans** → archived after `/week-plan` runs
- **Quarterly reviews** → archived after `/quarter-review` runs

## Manual Archiving

When projects complete or areas go dormant:
- Move project files from `04-Projects/` → `07-Archives/Projects/`
- Add completion date and outcome summary
- Keep the same filename for easy searching

## Retention

Keep archives indefinitely—they're your historical record and learning source. When doing quarterly reviews, you'll reference these to understand patterns and growth.

## Naming Convention

Maintain original naming:
- Projects: `Project_Name.md`
- Plans: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Reviews: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `YYYY-Qx.md`

## Searching Archives

Archives are optimized for search, not browsing. When you need historical context:
- Search by date: "2025-Q3"
- Search by topic: "customer onboarding"
- Search by person: "John_Smith"
