# Quarterly Reviews

End-of-quarter reviews and retrospectives.

## What Goes Here

When you run `/quarter-review` at the end of each quarter, Dex creates a comprehensive review document here covering:

- **Goal completion** — What you achieved against quarterly goals
- **Pillar alignment** — How work distributed across strategic pillars
- **Key learnings** — Insights to carry forward
- **What worked / didn't work** — Process and workflow reflections
- **Next quarter setup** — Context for planning ahead

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-Qx.md` (e.g., `2026-Q1.md` for Q1 2026)

## Purpose

Quarterly reviews help you:
- Maintain long-term perspective
- Spot patterns across months
- Adjust strategic direction
- Celebrate progress
- Learn from what didn't work

## Integration

- Informs next quarter's planning (via `/quarter-plan`)
- Surfaces learnings for 06-Resources/Learnings/
- Tracks pillar balance over time (via Work MCP's `get_pillar_summary` tool)
- Provides context for annual reviews

## Reflection Questions

Each review prompts you to consider:
- What had the most impact?
- What should you stop/start/continue?
- How did your focus areas evolve?
- What surprised you?
- What would you do differently?
