# Learnings

Compound knowledge organized by topic.

## What Goes Here

- **Frameworks** — Mental models and thinking tools you've developed
- **Best practices** — Lessons learned from projects and experiences
- **Technical learnings** — Deep dives into tools, technologies, or techniques
- **People insights** — Patterns in working with teams or stakeholders
- **Process improvements** — What works and doesn't work in your workflow

## Philosophy

This folder is for knowledge that **compounds** — insights that become more valuable over time and serve as reference points for future decisions.

## Sources

Learnings flow here from:
- Weekly reviews (via `/week-review`)
- Project retrospectives
- Significant sessions (prompted via `/daily-review`)
- Career reflections (via `/career-coach`)

## Organization

Organize by topic or theme:
- `Leadership_Principles.md`
- `Technical_Architecture_Lessons.md`
- `Stakeholder_Management_Patterns.md`
- `Product_Strategy_Frameworks.md`

## When to Create a Learning

Ask yourself: "Will I reference this again? Does this inform future decisions?"

If yes, it belongs here. If it's one-time context, keep it in the meeting note or project page.

## Usage

- Reference during planning (weekly/quarterly)
- Review before similar projects
- Share with teammates or mentees
- Revisit during career reflections
