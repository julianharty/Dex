## What Goes Here

Reference material that:
- You'll consult repeatedly
- Provides context for decisions
- Doesn't fit in a specific project or area
- Has lasting value beyond current work

## Examples

- **Documentation** — System guides, how-tos, process docs

- **Research** — Industry research, competitive analysis
- **Policies** — Company policies, guidelines

**Note:** Templates are stored in `System/Templates/` for easy access during file creation.

## vs. Archives

**Resources** = you actively reference this  
**Archives** = historical record, consulted rarely

If you haven't looked at something in 6+ months, consider archiving it.
