# Strategic Pillars Configuration
# 
# Pillars are your main focus areas — think of them as how you carve up your role thematically.
# These are NOT time-bound (like quarterly goals). They represent ongoing areas of responsibility
# that typically stay consistent for 6-12+ months, or until your role significantly changes.
#
# PILLAR (ongoing):           GOAL (time-bound):
# "Revenue Growth"      vs    "Hit 150% quota in Q1"
# "Product Strategy"    vs    "Launch mobile app"
# "Customer Retention"  vs    "Reduce churn to <2%"
#
# Want to change your pillars? Just chat with Claude: "I need to reconfigure my strategic pillars"
# — it'll help you update how your work ladders up to new focus areas.
#
# The Work MCP uses these to categorize tasks and check balance across your work.
