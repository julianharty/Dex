# Templates

Templates used by Dex automation for consistent structure.

## Available Templates

These templates are actively used by Dex skills:

- **`Person_Page.md`** — Person page structure (used when creating person pages)
- **`Company.md`** — Company page structure (used by `/process-meetings`)
- **`Career_Evidence_Achievement.md`** — Achievement capture (used by `/week-review`, `/resume-builder`)
- **`Career_Evidence_Feedback.md`** — Feedback tracking (used by career system)

## Usage

Dex automatically uses these templates when creating new files through skills and automation. You can modify them to match your preferences.

## Note on Manual File Creation

If you're creating files manually (person pages, company pages, etc.), you can copy these templates as a starting point, but Dex will work fine with any structure you prefer.
