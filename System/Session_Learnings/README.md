# Session Learnings

System improvements discovered during work sessions.

## What Goes Here

Meta-feedback about Dex itself, captured during `/review`:

- **Mistakes or corrections** — Things that went wrong and how to fix them
- **Preferences mentioned** — Workflow preferences you shared
- **Documentation gaps** — Places where docs were unclear or missing
- **Workflow inefficiencies** — Friction points discovered

## Format

Each learning includes:
- **What happened** — Specific situation
- **Why it matters** — Impact on system/workflow
- **Suggested fix** — Specific action with file paths
- **Status** — pending, implemented, or won't-fix

## Naming Convention

`YYYY-MM-DD.md` (one file per day)

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — Happens automatically during `/review` (daily review)
2. **Review** — Periodically check pending learnings via `/dex-whats-new`
3. **Implement** — Fix documentation gaps or system issues
4. **Update status** — Mark as implemented when done

## vs. Dex Backlog

**Session Learnings** = specific bugs or doc gaps discovered  
**Dex Backlog** = feature ideas and improvements (in `System/Dex_Backlog.md`)

Both feed into system improvements, but learnings are reactive (fixing issues) while the backlog is proactive (new capabilities).

## Integration

- `/dex-whats-new` checks for pending learnings
- Weekly reviews surface unaddressed learnings
- Helps Dex evolve based on actual usage patterns

This enables Dex to learn from your usage and improve over time.
