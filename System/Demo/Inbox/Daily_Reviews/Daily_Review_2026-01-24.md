# Daily Review - Friday, January 24, 2026

## What Got Done

- [x] Sprint planning meeting - team aligned on final push
- [x] Stakeholder update - launch date approved
- [x] Reviewed Maya's app store assets

## What Didn't Get Done

- [ ] Write PRD for portal - ran out of time
- [ ] Send API roadmap to Lisa - need to draft first

## Open Loops

- Push notification fix - Jordan working over weekend
- Acme case study approval - waiting on Sarah to talk to Tom
- Portal user interviews - only 3 scheduled, need 5 more

## Energy/Focus

Productive day but mentally tired. Meetings back-to-back in afternoon made deep work hard.

## Tomorrow's Focus

1. Write PRD for customer portal (block 2 hours morning)
2. Draft API roadmap overview for Lisa
3. Prep for Monday's week kickoff

## Wins

- Launch date officially approved by leadership
- Sprint team confident on delivery
- Good partner conversation with Lisa

## Learnings

- Should have blocked PRD writing time on calendar
- Stakeholder meetings are easier when I send pre-read
