# Partner API Ecosystem Play

**Captured:** 2026-01-23  
**Source:** Partner discovery call with Lisa Park

## The Idea

Instead of thinking about mobile as just our product, what if we positioned it as a platform that third parties can build on top of? Lisa's company wants to integrate with our mobile app - they're not alone. We could create an ecosystem of partner integrations.

## Why This Matters

- Revenue opportunity: Partner tier subscriptions
- Platform moat: Harder to leave if you have integrations
- Feature velocity: Partners build what we can't prioritize
- Strategic positioning: Platform play vs point solution

## What Would Need to Change

- Public API strategy (currently limited)
- Developer documentation and tooling
- Partner program and pricing model
- Security/permission model for third-party access

## Who to Talk To

- Jordan (technical feasibility, API architecture)
- Sales team (how to sell partner tier)
- Legal/Security (third-party access policies)
- Other potential partners beyond Lisa

## Next Actions

- Draft API partnership proposal
- Socialize with exec team
- Research competitor API strategies
- Build business case (revenue model)
