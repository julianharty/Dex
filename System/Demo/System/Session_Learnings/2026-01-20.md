# Session Learnings - January 20, 2026

## [09:30] - Timeline decision paralysis pattern

**What happened:** Realized I've been delaying mobile launch timeline decision for 2 weeks, asking for "one more analysis" when Jordan was ready to commit. This blocked Marketing and Sales planning.

**Why it matters:** Analysis paralysis vs informed decision-making. When you have enough info to understand risks, decide - perfect timeline doesn't exist.

**Suggested fix:** Add pattern to `06-Resources/Learnings/Mistake_Patterns.md` - "Over-analyzing Before Deciding" rule. Define decision deadlines upfront. Ask: "Will more analysis materially change this decision?"

**Status:** pending

## [14:30] - Multi-persona research blind spot

**What happened:** Acme beta feedback revealed Tom (IT Director) has completely different priorities than Sarah (PM). We'd only designed for Sarah's perspective - missed security/admin requirements that Tom cares about.

**Why it matters:** B2B products serve multiple personas (end users, buyers, technical gatekeepers). One perspective creates blind spots and late-stage surprises.

**Suggested fix:** Add to `06-Resources/Learnings/Mistake_Patterns.md` - "Single Persona Trap in Research" rule. Always map personas upfront and include 2-3 from each type in research.

## [16:00] - Jordan's risk communication insight

**What happened:** When Jordan expressed concerns about push notification integration, I initially thought he was saying "we can't do it." But he clarified - he wanted to make sure *I* understood the risk before we committed. Once I demonstrated understanding and accepted the risk, he was comfortable moving forward.

**Why it matters:** Engineering concerns aren't always blockers - sometimes they're risk communication. Make sure PM understands technical risk before team commits.

**Suggested fix:** Add to `06-Resources/Learnings/Working_Preferences.md` under "Cross-Functional Work" - when eng raises technical concerns, ask: "Are you saying this is impossible, or that I need to understand the risk before we commit?" Document this communication pattern with engineering partners.
