### Promotion Discussion

**L4 → L5 (Staff PM) Readiness: In Progress**

Alex is performing strongly at L4 and showing some L5 behaviors. With focused development in organizational influence and strategic thinking, Alex could be ready for L5 consideration in 6-9 months.

**What's needed for L5:**
- ✅ Execution track record (has this)
- ✅ Cross-functional partnerships (strong with eng/design)
- ⏳ Broader organizational influence (developing)
- ⏳ Platform/strategic thinking (needs more evidence)
- ⏳ Executive presence (needs development)
- ⏳ Multi-team leadership (needs examples)

**Development Plan:**
- Mobile launch provides opportunity for exec visibility
- Series D fundraising creates investor presentation opportunity
- API Partner Program could be the multi-team initiative
- Work with manager on strategic writing practice

### Manager Comments

"Alex consistently delivers high-quality work and has become a trusted partner to Engineering and Design. I'd like to see Alex broaden influence beyond the immediate team and develop more platform-level thinking. The mobile launch is a great opportunity to demonstrate both. Alex is on track for L5 consideration in 6-9 months with continued growth."
