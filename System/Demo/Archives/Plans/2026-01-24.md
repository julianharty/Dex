## Must Do Today

1. **Sprint planning with Jordan** ⭐
   - Finalize next sprint goals (final QA + polish)
   - Confirm team capacity and confidence
   - Review any technical risks
   - Why it matters: Last major sprint before launch prep

2. **Sales call with Mike**
   - Learn how Sales is positioning mobile
   - Understand customer objections and questions
   - Offer to join 2-3 customer calls next week
   - Why it matters: L5 development - cross-functional partnerships

3. **Stakeholder update meeting (exec team)**

## Should Do Today

4. **Wrap up loose ends for week**
   - Clear critical emails
   - Update tasks for next week
   - Document week's accomplishments

5. **Weekly review prep**
   - Gather this week's highlights
   - Identify patterns and learnings
   - Plan for next week

---

## Could Do (If Time Permits)

6. **Continue strategy doc**
   - If energy permits after meetings
   - Probably save for Monday with fresh energy

7. **Portal PRD outline**
   - Start thinking through structure
   - Kickoff meeting next week

---

## Blockers / Risks

- Friday energy is always lower
- 3 back-to-back meetings (9am-12pm) will be draining
- Stakeholder meeting could uncover new concerns/blockers

---

## Key Opportunities

**Stakeholder update:** Practice exec communication - strategic, concise, confident. This is L5-level visibility. Focus on: clear status, key decisions, what I need from them.

**Sales call:** Build the relationship, don't just extract information. This is the start of ongoing partnership.

---

## Evening Check-in

**Plan to review:**
- How did stakeholder meeting go? (Critical for L5 evidence)
- What did I learn from Mike about Sales positioning?
- What are the themes from this week?

*Plan created: 7:55 AM*
