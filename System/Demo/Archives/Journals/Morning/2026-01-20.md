# Morning Journal - Monday, January 20, 2026

## Energy Check
**Physical:** 7/10 - Good sleep, feeling ready  
**Mental:** 8/10 - Focused and clear  
**Emotional:** 7/10 - Bit anxious about mobile launch timeline

---

## What matters most today?

Getting clarity on the mobile launch timeline. Jordan and I need to finalize the schedule today - this is blocking other teams. If we don't lock this down, Marketing can't plan the launch campaign and Sales can't commit to customer timelines.

Also looking forward to the Acme beta feedback call. Sarah's been testing the mobile app and her team always gives great insights.

## What might derail me?

- Could get pulled into random meetings if I'm not careful
- Email backlog from weekend (probably 50+ messages)
- Tendency to get into weeds on technical discussions with Jordan - need to stay focused on timeline decisions, not architecture details

---

## Intention for the day

**Primary focus:** Lock down mobile launch timeline with Jordan

**How I want to show up:**
- Decisive - we've analyzed enough, time to commit
- Collaborative with Jordan - this is a partnership decision
- Clear communicator - make sure timeline is documented and shared

**Reminder to self:** The perfect timeline doesn't exist. Done is better than perfect here. Pick a realistic date, commit, communicate.

## Gratitude

- Great product/eng partnership with Jordan - makes hard conversations easier
- Strong beta customer relationships (Acme especially)
- Team is executing well despite pressure
