## What matters most today?

Design review with Maya at 11am for customer portal wireframes. This is important - portal is the next big project after mobile launches. Want to give Maya good feedback and set the project up for success.

Also want to start building Sales relationships like Sarah suggested. Going to reach out to the Sales lead about mobile launch and offer to help with customer conversations.

## What might derail me?

- Design review could run long if we get into detailed feedback
- Might overthink the Sales outreach (just send the message!)
- Could get pulled into mobile launch firefighting

---

## Intention for the day

**Primary focus:** Give Maya great feedback on portal designs

**How I want to show up:**
- Thoughtful design partner - specific feedback, not vague
- Proactive on Sales relationship - take Sarah's advice seriously
- Strategic thinker - connect portal work to bigger picture

**Reminder to self:** Sarah said to broaden influence beyond eng/design. Reaching out to Sales is exactly that. Don't overthink it, just do it.

## Gratitude

- Maya's design work is always excellent
- Career clarity from yesterday's 1:1
- Mobile launch timeline stress is behind me
