## What matters most today?

Two important meetings today:
1. **Sprint planning with Jordan** (9am) - Set up next week's sprint
2. **Stakeholder update** (3pm) - Share mobile progress with exec team

Both are opportunities to demonstrate leadership and keep mobile launch on track.

Also meeting with Mike (Sales) at 11am - excited to learn how Sales is positioning mobile and start building that relationship.

## What might derail me?

- Friday energy is always lower
- Temptation to mentally check out before weekend
- Stakeholder meeting could uncover new concerns/blockers

---

## Intention for the day

**Primary focus:** Strong finish to the week - sprint planning + stakeholder update

**How I want to show up:**
- Energized despite Friday fatigue
- Clear communicator in stakeholder update (exec-level communication)
- Curious learner in Sales call (not defensive)

**Reminder to self:** Stakeholder update is a chance to practice exec communication. Be strategic, concise, confident. This is L5-level visibility.
