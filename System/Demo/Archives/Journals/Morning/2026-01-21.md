# Morning Journal - Tuesday, January 21, 2026

## Energy Check
**Physical:** 6/10 - Decent sleep but woke up early  
**Mental:** 7/10 - Clear on priorities  
**Emotional:** 6/10 - Feeling pressure on board prep

## What matters most today?

Board meeting is next week and I need to review competitor analysis. This is high visibility - CEO wants a clear competitive positioning story for the mobile launch.

Also have my 1:1 with Sarah (manager) at 2pm. Want to talk about L5 progression and how mobile launch is building my promotion case.

---

## What might derail me?

- 1:1 with Jordan at 10am might run long (they often do)
- Temptation to dive deep on competitive research vs getting the summary done
- Could get distracted by mobile launch details instead of focusing on board prep

---

## Intention for the day

**Primary focus:** Nail the competitor analysis for board prep

**How I want to show up:**
- Strategic thinker - not just features, but market positioning
- Prepared for 1:1 with Sarah - clear on career goals
- Efficient with time - don't let perfectionism slow me down

**Reminder to self:** The board wants the strategic narrative, not exhaustive feature comparison. Keep it high-level and compelling.

## Gratitude

- Timeline clarity from yesterday reduces today's anxiety
- Looking forward to career conversation with Sarah
- Competitor research is actually interesting work
