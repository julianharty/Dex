## Daily Review

**Overall:** 9/10 - Excellent day, made real progress

---

## What got done

✅ **1:1 with Jordan** - Good sync on sprint planning. He's confident about the Feb 15 date now that we've had a day to socialize it with the team.

✅ **Competitor analysis review** - Completed! Found some interesting positioning opportunities. Our mobile app is more integrated with the web platform than competitors - that's our differentiator.

✅ **1:1 with Sarah (manager)** - Amazing conversation about L5 progression. She thinks I'm operating at L5 level on mobile launch and could be ready for promotion by Q3. She specifically called out my exec presentations and cross-functional leadership. Need to focus on: broadening influence (Sales/Marketing), platform thinking, and executive communication.

✅ **Mobile timeline communication** - Sent update to all stakeholders about Feb 15 date

## What I learned

**About competitive positioning:** Sometimes the differentiator isn't about having more features - it's about integration and workflow. Our mobile app is powerful *because* it's deeply integrated with our web platform. Competitors have more features but worse integration.

**About career progression:** Sarah's feedback was eye-opening. She sees me as L5-ready on mobile launch but wants me to:
1. Build stronger Sales/Marketing relationships (I'm too eng/design focused)
2. Write more strategy docs (practice strategic narratives)
3. Get more exec/investor visibility

The mobile launch is my signature project for L5. Need to document everything.

**About executive communication:** Sarah said my exec presentations have improved a lot - more strategic, less in the weeds. Keep practicing that level of communication.

## Energy reflection

**What energized me:**
- Career conversation with Sarah - feeling clear on path to L5
- Competitor insights - found our positioning angle
- Jordan's confidence in the timeline

**What drained me:**
- Afternoon energy dip around 3pm
- Too much time in email again

---

## Tomorrow's focus

1. **Design review with Maya** - Customer portal wireframes
2. **Start building Sales relationships** - Reach out to Sales lead about mobile
3. **Write mobile platform strategy doc** - Practice strategic writing (Sarah's suggestion)

## Career note

Today's 1:1 with Sarah was a turning point. Mobile launch + documented evidence + 6 months of growth = L5 by October. Clear path forward. Need to be more intentional about building evidence.

## Gratitude

- Sarah's mentorship and clear career guidance
- Competitive research revealing our positioning strength
- Strong partnership with Jordan continuing
