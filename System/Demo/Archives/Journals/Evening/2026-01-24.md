## Daily Review

**Overall:** 8/10 - Strong end to a great week

---

## What got done

✅ **Sprint planning with Jordan** - Solid session. Next sprint is focused on final QA and polish. Jordan's team is confident about Feb 15 launch.

✅ **Sales call with Mike** - Eye-opening! Learned how Sales is positioning mobile (enterprise productivity angle). Mike wants me to join 2-3 customer calls next week. This partnership is going to be valuable for both of us.

✅ **Stakeholder update meeting** - Went really well! CEO said "mobile launch is our most important Q1 initiative and Alex has kept us on track." That was validating. Practiced concise, strategic communication - felt like L5-level presence.

✅ **Wrapped up loose ends for the week**

## What I learned

**About Sales:** Mike showed me how they're positioning mobile - very different angle than I expected. They're selling it as "enterprise productivity for distributed teams" not "mobile access to platform." That's smart - speaks to customer pain better than our feature-focused messaging. I need to incorporate this positioning into our launch materials.

**About executive communication:** In the stakeholder meeting, I used the "strategic, concise, confident" approach. CEO's comment about keeping us on track confirms it worked. The formula: clear status, key decisions, what I need from them. No fluff, no over-explaining.

**About cross-functional partnerships:** The Sales relationship is already paying off. Mike's positioning insights are valuable, and he gets help with technical conversations. Win-win. This is exactly the broadened influence Sarah wants to see.
