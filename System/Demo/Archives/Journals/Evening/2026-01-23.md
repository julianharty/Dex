# Evening Journal - Thursday, January 23, 2026

## Daily Review

**Overall:** 8/10 - Great focus day

---

## What got done

✅ **2 hours on mobile platform strategy doc (9-11am)** - Finally! Got the outline complete and first draft of strategy section. Closing Slack made a huge difference. This is the strategic writing practice Sarah wants to see.

✅ **Partner discovery call with Lisa Park** - Fascinating conversation. Her company wants to build integrations on top of our platform. Could be huge opportunity for ecosystem play. Need to think about API strategy more broadly - this is bigger than just mobile.

✅ **Reviewed portal user interview schedule** - 5 customers confirmed for next week

✅ **Mobile beta check-in** - All green, beta users happy

## What I learned

**About deep work:** The 9-11am strategy doc session was proof - I need 2+ hour blocks with zero interruptions for strategic thinking. Can't write good strategy in 30-minute fragments. Need to protect this time more intentionally.

**About API/platform strategy:** Lisa's conversation opened my eyes. We've been thinking about mobile as a product, but it's actually a platform play. Third parties want to build on top of us. This is the platform thinking Sarah wants me to demonstrate. The mobile platform strategy doc should address ecosystem opportunities, not just our own roadmap.

**About partnership opportunities:** Sometimes the best opportunities come from unexpected places. I wasn't expecting the partner call to be so strategic, but Lisa's vision for integrations is compelling.

## Energy reflection

**What energized me:**
- Deep focus time on strategy doc - felt like real thinking
- Lisa's vision for platform partnerships
- Making tangible progress on L5 development goals

**What drained me:**
- Late afternoon energy crash (3:30pm)
- Too many small decisions throughout the day

## Tomorrow's focus

1. **Sprint planning with Jordan** - Week ahead planning
2. **Sales call with Mike** - Learn how Sales is positioning mobile
3. **Stakeholder update meeting** - Share mobile timeline, get exec alignment
4. **Continue strategy doc** - Another 2-hour block if possible

## Career note

The platform thinking is clicking. Mobile isn't just an app - it's a platform for ecosystem partnerships. This is L5-level strategic thinking. Document this insight in the strategy doc.

## Gratitude

- Protected focus time paying off
- Lisa's partnership vision expanding my thinking
- Clear line of sight to L5 goals
