## Daily Review

**Overall:** 7/10 - Solid day, good progress

---

## What got done

✅ **Design review with Maya** - Portal wireframes look great! Maya incorporated a lot of the customer feedback from our research. Gave feedback on information architecture and navigation flow. She's making some adjustments but overall we're aligned.

✅ **Reached out to Sales lead** - Sent message to Mike (VP Sales) offering to help with mobile launch customer conversations. Also asked to join a sales call to learn how they're positioning the mobile app. He responded positively - meeting scheduled for Friday.

✅ **Mobile sprint check-in** - Quick sync with Jordan, beta is going well, no major issues

⏸️ **Mobile platform strategy doc** - Started outline but didn't finish, ran out of time

## What I learned

**About design partnership:** Maya mentioned something interesting - when I give design feedback, I always connect it to customer insights or data. That makes the feedback more compelling than just "I think this should be different." Good reminder to always ground feedback in evidence.

**About Sales outreach:** Mike was surprisingly enthusiastic about having me join customer calls. He said Sales often struggles to explain the technical details and would love PM support. This is going to be a good partnership.

**About cross-functional work:** Reaching out to Sales felt awkward at first (we don't work together much), but Mike was welcoming. Lesson: Don't let past patterns limit future collaboration. People are usually open to partnership if you make the first move.

## Energy reflection

**What energized me:**
- Maya's design work - she's so good at translating user needs to UI
- Mike's positive response to Sales partnership
- Feeling like I'm taking action on Sarah's career advice

**What drained me:**
- Afternoon meetings back-to-back (3pm-5pm)
- Didn't get enough focus time for strategic writing

---

## Tomorrow's focus

1. **Partner discovery call with Lisa** - API roadmap discussion
2. **Continue mobile platform strategy doc** - Need 2 hours of focus time
3. **Review portal user interview schedule** - Make sure we have 5 customers lined up

## Career note

Took action on Sarah's advice about Sales relationships. Mike meeting on Friday. Building evidence of cross-functional influence for L5.

## Gratitude

- Maya's excellent design work
