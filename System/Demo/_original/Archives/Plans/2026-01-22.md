# Daily Plan - Wednesday, January 22, 2026

## Morning Journal

Started with morning journal - energized by yesterday's career clarity from Sarah. Ready to take action on her feedback.

**Energy:** 8/10  
**What matters most:** Give Maya great feedback on portal designs + start Sales relationship

---

## Today's Context

### Calendar

| Time | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 11:00-12:00 | Design review with Maya | Customer portal wireframes |
| 2:00-3:00 | Mobile sprint check-in | Quick sync with Jordan |

### Top Priority from Week

**Customer Portal Kickoff** - Starting to ramp up alongside mobile launch

---

## Must Do Today

1. **Design review with Maya - Portal wireframes** ⭐
   - Review information architecture
   - Give specific, customer-grounded feedback
   - Flag any concerns about user research findings
   - Why it matters: Set portal project up for success

2. **Reach out to Sales lead (Mike)**
   - Act on Sarah's feedback to broaden influence
   - Offer to help with mobile launch customer conversations
   - Ask to join Sales call to learn positioning
   - Why it matters: L5 requires cross-functional relationships beyond eng/design

---

## Should Do Today

3. **Mobile sprint check-in with Jordan**
   - Beta status update
   - Any technical issues surfacing?
   - Confirm next week's focus

4. **Continue mobile platform strategy doc**
   - 2-hour focus block (9-11am)
   - Close Slack, focus on strategic writing
   - Get first draft of strategy section done

---

## Could Do (If Time Permits)

5. **Portal interview schedule**
   - Confirm 5 customers for next week
   - Send calendar invites

6. **Update task priorities**
   - Review backlog post-timeline decision
   - Re-prioritize based on launch date

---

## Blockers / Risks

- Design review could run long if we get into details
- Might overthink the Sales outreach (just send it!)
- Could get pulled into mobile launch firefighting

---

## Key Actions

**Sales outreach:** Don't overthink this. Simple message: "Would love to learn more about how Sales is positioning mobile. Can we chat?" Schedule meeting before perfect-crafting message.

---

## Evening Check-in

**Plan to review:**
- Did I give Maya useful feedback?
- Did I reach out to Mike? (Critical for L5 development)
- How much progress on strategy doc?

*Plan created: 8:10 AM*
