# Daily Plan - Thursday, January 23, 2026

## Morning Journal

Started with morning journal - feeling productive rhythm this week. Excited about partner conversation with Lisa.

**Energy:** 7/10  
**What matters most:** Partner discovery call + protected focus time for strategy doc

---

## Today's Context

### Calendar

| Time | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 9:00-11:00 | BLOCKED - Focus time | Strategy doc writing (no meetings!) |
| 2:00-3:00 | Partner discovery - Lisa Park | API integration discussion |

### Top Priority from Week

**Mobile App Launch Readiness** - Beta phase going well, focus shifting to launch prep

---

## Must Do Today

1. **Protected focus time: Mobile platform strategy doc** ⭐ (9-11am)
   - Close Slack completely
   - Complete outline and first draft of strategy section
   - Think platform-level, not just feature-level
   - Why it matters: Sarah wants to see strategic writing for L5

2. **Partner discovery call with Lisa Park**
   - Understand their integration needs
   - Explore API partnership opportunities
   - Think ecosystem play, not just features
   - Why it matters: Platform thinking opportunity

---

## Should Do Today

3. **Review portal user interview schedule**
   - Confirm 5 customers for next week
   - Send prep materials to participants

4. **Mobile beta check-in**
   - Quick Slack check with Jordan
   - Review beta user feedback from this week
   - Any issues surfacing?

---

## Could Do (If Time Permits)

5. **Prep for tomorrow's meetings**
   - Sprint planning with Jordan (Friday 9am)
   - Sales call with Mike (Friday 11am)
   - Stakeholder update (Friday 3pm)

6. **Update career evidence**
   - Document this week's L5 examples
   - Career folder updates

---

## Blockers / Risks

- Partner call might surface scope creep (new API requirements)
- Slack notifications during focus time (must close it!)
- Tendency to accept meeting requests instead of protecting writing time

---

## Key Commitments

**9-11am focus time is sacred.** No email, no Slack, no meetings. Strategy doc requires deep thinking that can't happen in fragments.

---

## Evening Check-in

**Plan to review:**
- Did I protect focus time? (2 hours of real focus)
- What did I learn from Lisa about API partnerships?
- How much of strategy doc is complete?

*Plan created: 8:00 AM*
