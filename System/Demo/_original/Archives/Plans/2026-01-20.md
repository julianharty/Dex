# Daily Plan - Monday, January 20, 2026

## Morning Journal

Started with morning journal - feeling anxious about mobile launch timeline but ready to lock it down today.

**Energy:** 7/10  
**What matters most:** Finalize mobile launch timeline with Jordan

## Today's Context

### Calendar

| Time | Event | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 10:00-11:00 | Mobile timeline discussion (Jordan) | Decision time - pick a date |
| 2:00-3:00 | Acme beta feedback call (Sarah, Tom) | First beta feedback session |

### Top Priority from Week

**Mobile App Launch Readiness** - Timeline clarity is blocking other teams

## Must Do Today

1. **Finalize mobile launch timeline with Jordan** ⭐
   - Review push notification risk assessment
   - Make the call on Feb 15 date
   - Document decision and communicate to all teams
   - Why it matters: Blocking Marketing, Sales, and launch planning

2. **Acme beta feedback call**
   - Listen for UX friction points
   - Capture security/admin concerns from Tom
   - Document feature requests for prioritization

3. **Email backlog catchup**
   - 50+ emails from weekend
   - Priority: Anything blocking mobile launch

4. **Review competitor analysis outline**
   - Prep for board meeting next week
   - Get structure done even if content incomplete
