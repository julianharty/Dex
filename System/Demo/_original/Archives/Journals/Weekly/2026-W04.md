# Weekly Journal - Week 4, 2026 (Jan 20-24)

## Week Overview

**Theme:** Clarity and momentum - locked mobile timeline, L5 career path, Sales partnership

**Overall:** 8/10 - One of my most productive weeks in months

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Mobile Launch Timeline Finalized
Locked in Feb 15 launch date with Jordan. This unblocked Marketing, Sales, and other teams. Made tough call to defer offline mode to v1.1. CEO validated the progress in stakeholder meeting.

**Why it matters:** Timeline clarity removes organizational bottleneck and demonstrates decision-making under pressure.

### 2. L5 Career Path Clarity
Sarah's 1:1 on Tuesday was transformative. She thinks I'm operating at L5 level on mobile launch and could be ready for promotion by Q3 (Sep/Oct). Clear development areas: broaden influence beyond eng/design, platform thinking, executive communication.

**Why it matters:** First time I have concrete path to next level. Mobile launch is my signature project for promotion case.

### 3. Sales Partnership Started
Reached out to Mike (VP Sales) about mobile launch collaboration. He was enthusiastic. Joined Sales call on Friday - learned their positioning angle ("enterprise productivity for distributed teams"). Will join 2-3 customer calls next week.

**Why it matters:** Directly addresses Sarah's feedback to broaden influence. Sales partnership benefits both sides.

### 4. Platform Thinking Breakthrough
Partner discovery call with Lisa Park revealed ecosystem opportunity - third parties want to build on our platform. Shifted my thinking from mobile-as-product to mobile-as-platform. This is the strategic thinking Sarah wants to see.

**Why it matters:** L5 requires platform-level thinking. This insight elevates the mobile strategy.

### 5. Executive Communication Win
Stakeholder update on Friday went well. CEO said "mobile launch is our most important Q1 initiative and Alex has kept us on track." Practiced strategic, concise communication.

**Why it matters:** Executive presence is L5 competency. Getting positive feedback from CEO.

## What I Learned

### About career progression
The gap between L4 and L5 is clearer now. It's not about working harder - it's about:
- Broadening influence (not just eng/design bubble)
- Thinking platform-level (not just feature-level)
- Executive communication (strategic narratives, concise updates)
- Multi-team leadership (cross-functional coordination)

Mobile launch gives me opportunities to demonstrate all of these.

### About decision-making
The timeline decision with Jordan taught me something: when engineering is worried about technical risk, they want to know that *I* understand the risk, not that we'll eliminate it. Once I demonstrated understanding of push notification risk and accepted it, Jordan was comfortable moving forward.

### About cross-functional partnerships
Reaching out to Sales felt awkward initially (we don't usually collaborate), but Mike was welcoming. Lesson: Don't let past patterns limit future opportunities. Most people are open to partnership if you make the first move.

### About platform thinking
Lisa's API partnership conversation shifted my perspective. Mobile isn't just an app for our users - it's a platform for ecosystem partners. This opens new strategic opportunities and is exactly the kind of big-picture thinking required for L5.

### About executive communication
The stakeholder update formula that worked: clear status, key decisions, what I need from them. No fluff, no over-explaining. CEO responded positively. Keep practicing this level of communication.

## Energy Patterns

**What energized me:**
- High-stakes strategic work (timeline decisions, platform thinking)
- Career progress and clarity
- Strong partnerships (Jordan, Maya, Sarah, Mike)
- Executive visibility and validation
- Making real impact

**What drained me:**
- Back-to-back meetings (Friday was brutal: 9am-4pm)
- Context switching between tactical and strategic work
- Afternoon energy dips (3-4pm every day)
- Too much time in email

**Best productivity:**
- 9-11am: Deep focus time (strategy doc session on Thursday proved this)
- Protected 2-hour blocks with Slack closed
- Days with clear priorities (vs reactive days)

---

## Patterns & Insights

### Time management
The Thursday morning strategy doc session (9-11am, Slack closed) was proof that I need protected 2-hour blocks for strategic work. Can't write good strategy in 30-minute fragments. Need to defend this time more intentionally.

### Relationship building
Three cross-functional conversations this week (Jordan timeline, Maya design review, Mike Sales) - all went well because I came prepared and focused on partnership, not just my needs. Pattern to continue.

### Career evidence
Starting to think more deliberately about capturing evidence for L5. Each week should generate 2-3 examples that demonstrate L5 competencies. This week: timeline decision, platform thinking, Sales partnership, exec communication.

## Next Week's Focus

## Challenges to Watch

1. **Energy management:** Friday was exhausting (9am-4pm meetings). Need to protect focus time better.
2. **Context switching:** Tactical mobile work vs strategic thinking - need better separation.
3. **Email management:** Still spending too much time in inbox.
4. **Writing practice:** Strategy doc progressing slowly - need more protected time.
