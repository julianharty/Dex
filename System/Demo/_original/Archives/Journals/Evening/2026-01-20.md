## Daily Review

**Overall:** 8/10 - Productive day, hit main goal

---

## What got done

✅ **Finalized mobile launch timeline with Jordan** - Big win! We locked in Feb 15 launch date. Jordan was initially nervous about push notification integration, but we agreed to accept that risk. Timeline is now documented and communicated to all teams.

✅ **Acme beta feedback call** - Great conversation with Sarah Chen and Tom Wilson. They love the core app but want better offline handling. We made the call to defer offline mode to v1.1 - can't let it block launch.

✅ **Caught up on email backlog** - Down to 12 unread (from 50+)

⏸️ **Competitor analysis review** - Pushed to tomorrow, ran out of time

## What I learned

**About timeline decisions:** Jordan taught me something today - when he's worried about a technical risk, it's not that he thinks we'll fail, it's that he wants to make sure *I* understand the risk before we commit. Once I demonstrated I understood the push notification risk and accepted it, he was comfortable moving forward.

**About beta customers:** Tom Wilson (Acme's IT director) has different priorities than Sarah (their PM). Sarah cares about UX, Tom cares about security and admin controls. Need to make sure we're getting feedback from multiple personas, not just the PM perspective.

**About scope decisions:** The offline mode discussion was hard but necessary. Maya pushed back on cutting it, but when I showed the timeline impact (3 weeks minimum), she agreed. Sometimes you have to show the trade-off clearly for people to accept the cut.

## Energy reflection

**What drained me:**
- Too many Slack interruptions in the afternoon
- Offline mode debate took longer than needed
- Feeling behind on competitor analysis

## Tomorrow's focus

1. **Competitor analysis review** - Prep for board meeting
2. **Check in with Marketing** - Now that timeline is set, they can plan launch
3. **Write timeline communication** - Document decision and send to all stakeholders
