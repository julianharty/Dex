# Morning Journal - Thursday, January 23, 2026

## Energy Check
**Physical:** 7/10 - Good energy  
**Mental:** 7/10 - Ready for partner conversation  
**Emotional:** 7/10 - Feeling productive rhythm

## What matters most today?

Partner discovery call with Lisa Park at 2pm. She represents a potential API partner and wants to understand our platform capabilities. This could be a great opportunity for third-party integrations - exactly the kind of platform thinking Sarah wants me to demonstrate.

Also need to carve out focus time for the mobile platform strategy doc. Keep getting interrupted and it's not getting done.

---

## What might derail me?

- Partner call might surface scope creep (new API requirements)
- Slack notifications during focus time
- Tendency to say yes to meeting requests instead of protecting writing time

---

## Intention for the day

**Primary focus:** Partner discovery call + 2 hours on strategy doc

**How I want to show up:**
- Strategic listener in partner call - understand their needs deeply
- Focused writer during strategy doc time - close Slack, ignore email
- Protective of my time - decline non-critical meetings

**Reminder to self:** Block 9-11am for writing BEFORE checking email. Writing requires deep focus.

## Gratitude

- Interesting partner opportunities emerging
- Progress on Sales relationship (Mike meeting tomorrow)
- Team executing well on mobile beta
