# Weekly Review - Week 3, 2026 (Jan 13-17)

## Week Overview

**Theme:** Mobile launch prep and beta feedback gathering

**Overall:** 7/10 - Productive week but some timeline anxiety

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Mobile Beta Launch
Successfully launched mobile app beta to 5 customers including Acme Corp. Beta access distributed, onboarding completed, first feedback sessions scheduled.

### 2. Feature Freeze Decision
Made the call to freeze features on Jan 20. This was hard - Maya wanted one more design iteration, but we needed to lock down scope. Team aligned after discussion.

### 3. Customer Portal Research
Completed 8 customer interviews for portal redesign. Clear themes emerging: navigation confusion, search needs improvement, want better mobile experience.

### 4. Board Prep Started
Began competitor analysis for next board meeting. CEO wants strong competitive positioning story for mobile launch.

## What I Learned

### About beta programs
Recruiting beta customers takes longer than expected. Originally planned for 10 customers, got 5. But quality > quantity - Acme Corp as anchor customer is more valuable than 10 lukewarm participants.

### About scope management
Feature freeze was the right call even though it was uncomfortable. Maya's additional iteration would have been nice-to-have, not must-have. Learning to differentiate.

### About customer research
8 interviews surfaced clear patterns. After interview 5, themes repeated. Probably could have stopped at 6. Learning when diminishing returns kick in.

## Energy Patterns

**What energized me:**
- Beta launch excitement
- Strong customer interview insights
- Jordan's positive feedback on PRD quality

**What drained me:**
- Timeline uncertainty (still not finalized)
- Too many interruptions mid-week
- Feature freeze debate took emotional energy

---

## Challenges

1. **Timeline anxiety:** Mobile launch timeline still not locked. Jordan needs more time to assess push notification risk. This is blocking other teams.

2. **Context switching:** Jumping between mobile launch, portal research, and board prep. Hard to maintain deep focus.

3. **Meeting overload:** Wednesday had 6 hours of meetings. Left no time for strategic thinking.

## Next Week's Focus

1. **Lock down mobile timeline** - This is blocking everything else
2. **Continue beta feedback** - First sessions with Acme, others
3. **Finish competitor analysis** - Board meeting in 2 weeks
4. **1:1 with Sarah** - Career development conversation

---

## Patterns to Watch

- Timeline decision paralysis - need to commit
- Protecting focus time better - too many interruptions
- Saying no to meeting requests
