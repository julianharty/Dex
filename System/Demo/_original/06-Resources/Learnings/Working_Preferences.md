# Working Preferences

Personal collaboration and communication preferences captured over time.

## Communication Style

### Feedback Delivery
- **Grounded in evidence:** Always connect feedback to customer insights or data, not just opinions
- **Specific over vague:** "The navigation flow on step 3 is confusing based on user testing" vs "This feels off"
- **Context first:** Explain the why before the what when requesting changes

### Written Communication
- **Bullet points preferred:** For updates and summaries (easier to scan than paragraphs)
- **Strategic narratives for executives:** High-level, concise, outcome-focused
- **Detailed specs for engineering:** Thorough requirements with acceptance criteria

### Meeting Preferences
- **Time-boxed agendas:** Tight agendas with clear outcomes
- **Async when possible:** Prefer Slack for updates, meetings for decisions
- **Video over phone:** Easier to read body language and stay engaged

## Work Rhythms

### Energy Patterns

- **Energizing activities:** High-stakes strategic work, strong partnerships, visible impact

## Decision-Making

### Risk Assessment
- **Understand risk, don't eliminate:** When technical risks exist, I want to understand them deeply so I can make informed decisions, not wait until risk is zero
- **Done > Perfect:** Prefer committing to realistic timelines over searching for perfect solutions
- **Data-informed, not data-driven:** Use data to inform, but don't let analysis paralysis delay decisions

*Captured: 2026-01-20 - Timeline decision with Jordan*

---

### Scope Management
- **Trade-offs require clarity:** Show the timeline/resource impact clearly to help stakeholders accept cuts
- **Defer, don't delete:** Prefer v1.1 roadmap for deferred features vs saying "never"
- **Customer-backed cuts:** Easier to cut features when customer research shows they're lower priority

*Captured: 2026-01-20 - Offline mode decision*

## Collaboration Preferences

### Partnership Style
- **Make the first move:** Don't wait for others to reach out - proactive relationship building
- **Focus on partnership, not just needs:** Start conversations with what we can do together, not just what I need
- **Come prepared:** Do homework before cross-functional conversations

*Captured: 2026-01-22 - Sales outreach reflection*

---

### Cross-Functional Work
- **Different personas, different priorities:** Remember that technical stakeholders (Tom) care about different things than product users (Sarah)
- **Engage multiple perspectives:** Don't just talk to PMs - include engineers, IT, operations in customer research
- **Build consensus through clarity:** When stakeholders disagree, clarify the trade-off rather than advocating for one side

## Strategic Thinking

### Platform vs Feature Thinking
- **Look for ecosystem plays:** Every product decision could enable third-party integration opportunities
- **Multi-quarter vision:** Think 12-18 months ahead, not just next sprint
- **Cross-product opportunities:** Consider how work in one area unlocks value in another

*Captured: 2026-01-23 - Lisa Park API partnership insight*

---

### Executive Communication
- **Formula:** Clear status → Key decisions → What I need from you
- **No fluff:** Skip the preamble, get to the point
- **Strategic, not tactical:** Focus on outcomes and implications, not implementation details
- **Confidence:** Declare position clearly, don't hedge unnecessarily

*Captured: 2026-01-24 - Stakeholder update success*

---

## Career Development

### Evidence Capture
- **Real-time capture:** Document achievements within days, not months later
- **Competency mapping:** Tag work with career competencies (L5 framework)
- **Feedback preservation:** Save specific quotes from leaders and partners
- **Weekly cadence:** Aim for 2-3 evidence examples per week

*Captured: 2026-01-21 - Manager career conversation*

---

### Growth Mindset
- **Proactive development:** Don't wait for opportunities - create them (like Sales partnership)
- **Practice new skills:** Executive communication, strategic writing - practice before it matters
- **Feedback seeking:** Ask for specific feedback on growth areas after presentations/projects
