## Pattern: Over-analyzing Before Deciding

### What Happened
Timeline decision for mobile launch took 2 weeks longer than needed. Kept requesting "one more analysis" of technical risks instead of making the call. Jordan was ready to commit earlier but I kept delaying.

### Why It's a Problem
- Delays block other teams (Marketing, Sales couldn't plan)
- Analysis paralysis vs informed decision-making
- Perfect timeline doesn't exist - need to commit and adapt

### The Rule
**When you have enough information to understand the risks and make an informed decision, decide.** More analysis rarely changes the decision, it just delays action.

**Red flags:**
- Asking for "one more" analysis
- Team is ready to commit but I'm hesitating
- Delaying decisions that are blocking other teams

### How to Avoid
1. Set decision deadlines (e.g., "We'll decide by Friday")
2. Define "enough information" criteria upfront
3. Remember: Perfect information doesn't exist, good enough is enough
4. Ask: "Will more analysis materially change this decision?"

## Pattern: Not Protecting Focus Time

### What Happened
Strategy doc took 3 weeks to make progress because I kept scheduling over my focus time. Would block 9-11am for writing, then accept a meeting request "just this once" that filled the slot.

### Why It's a Problem
- Strategic work requires 2+ hour uninterrupted blocks
- Can't write good strategy in 30-minute fragments
- Meeting-heavy days leave no room for deep thinking
- Reactive schedule vs proactive schedule control

### The Rule
**Protected focus time is non-negotiable. Treat it like a meeting with your most important stakeholder (yourself).**

**Red flags:**
- Accepting meetings during blocked focus time
- "Just this once" exceptions becoming the pattern
- Strategic work perpetually pushed to "tomorrow"

### How to Avoid
1. Block 9-11am daily for deep work, mark as "Busy" (not tentative)
2. No exceptions unless true emergency
3. Batch meetings in afternoon (post-lunch)
4. Review calendar Sunday evening, protect focus blocks for week
5. If someone requests focus time, offer afternoon alternatives

## Pattern: Single Persona Trap in Research

### What Happened
Initial mobile beta feedback came only from Sarah (PM at Acme). When Tom (IT Director) finally joined, his priorities were completely different (security/admin controls vs UX). Realized too late we'd designed for one persona.

### Why It's a Problem
- PMs care about different things than IT, operations, end users
- One perspective creates blind spots
- Late-stage surprises about requirements
- Risk of missing critical stakeholder needs

### The Rule
**For B2B products, always research multiple personas: end users, buyers, technical gatekeepers, operations.**

**Red flags:**
- Only talking to one type of person (e.g., just PMs)
- Assuming one persona speaks for all stakeholders
- Late discovery of "other stakeholders" with concerns

### How to Avoid
1. Map personas upfront: Who uses it? Who buys it? Who implements it?
2. Include all personas in research (minimum 2-3 from each)
3. Explicitly ask: "Who else should I talk to about this?"
4. In B2B: Always include technical stakeholders (IT, security, ops)
5. Validate findings across personas before committing to decisions

## Pattern: Deferring Cross-Functional Outreach

### What Happened
Manager suggested building stronger Sales relationships in January 1:1. Didn't act on it for a week - felt awkward reaching out to people I don't usually work with. When I finally reached out, Mike (VP Sales) was enthusiastic and collaborative.

### Why It's a Problem
- Letting discomfort delay valuable partnerships
- Past patterns limiting future collaboration
- Missing opportunities for cross-functional learning
- Creating silos by staying in eng/design bubble

### The Rule
**When you identify a relationship gap, reach out within 24 hours. Most people are more open to collaboration than you expect.**

**Red flags:**
- "I'll reach out next week" delays
- Overthinking the outreach message
- Staying comfortable in existing team relationships
- Waiting for others to initiate

### How to Avoid
1. Act on relationship-building feedback immediately (same day/next day)
2. Simple outreach works: "Would love to learn more about [their area], can we chat?"
3. Assume positive intent - people usually welcome collaboration
4. Schedule the meeting before perfect-crafting the message
5. Remember: Proactive > reactive for career growth
