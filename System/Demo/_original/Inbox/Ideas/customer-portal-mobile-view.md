# Customer Portal Mobile View

**Captured:** 2026-01-22  
**Source:** Design review with Maya

## The Idea

During portal design review, realized the wireframes are all desktop-focused. With mobile app launching, customers will expect portal to work on mobile too. Should we design mobile-responsive portal from the start?

## Why This Matters

- Mobile app creates expectation of mobile experience everywhere
- 40% of portal traffic could be mobile within 6 months (based on industry trends)
- Harder to retrofit responsive design later
- Competitive differentiator if we nail it

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**
- Future-proof the portal
- Better customer experience
- Aligns with mobile-first strategy

**Cons:**
- Adds 2-3 weeks to timeline (Maya's estimate)
- More testing complexity
- Resource constraint with mobile launch

## Decision Needed

Do we:
1. Design responsive from start (delay portal by 2-3 weeks)
2. Ship desktop-only, add mobile view in v1.1
3. Hybrid: Mobile-friendly but not fully optimized

## Who Needs to Weigh In

- Maya (design feasibility)
- Jordan (engineering effort)
- Sarah (manager - strategic priority)
- Customer Success (customer feedback on mobile usage)

## Next Actions

- Get data on current portal mobile traffic
- Ask Customer Success about mobile usage patterns
- Discuss trade-offs in next planning meeting
- Make scope decision by next week
